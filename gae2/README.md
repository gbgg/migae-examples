# The Ghastly dev_appserver REPL Hack

This exercise demonstrates a devious hack by means of which we get
repl-like interactive development using the GAE dev_appserver.

## Introduction

In a nutshell: gen-class the servlet, implement the app logic in a
separate namespace so it is eligible for reload, install a Servlet
Filter to reload the Clojure code on browser refresh, and finally -
here's the real hack - arrange things so that your code edits get
copied to war/WEB-INF/classes.  That way your source stays put in the
src/ tree, but a copy of it becomes visible to the Clojure runtime
within the dev_appserver sandbox.

There are two simple ways to do this.  So simple they hardly even
qualify as hacks.  Once is to just use `cp`; that's implemented in
`repl.sh`.  The other is to have your editor's save command trigger
the copy; that's what `migae-save-buffer.el` does, for emacs.


## Configuration

GAE requires that certain jar files be in war/WEB-INF/lib: everything
in $GAESDK/lib/user.  (See the `build.xml` file that comes with the
demos in the SDK.)
